# Rustpages

## Purpose

Rustpages is a framework based on the structure of [jpages framework](https://github.com/yegor256/jpages) and the OOP style guides by [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html).
It serves as the foundation for another project to build a terminal-based editor like [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) with a separate UI and core, communicating via `JSON` over `stdin`/`stdout`.
